## 3.9.0

`2018-09-02`

In September we brought an update for `3.9.0`. There are many new features in `3.9.0`, Ant Design is getting stronger and solider.

- 🔥🔥🔥 In the `3.9.0` version, we redraw all the icons, adding two new categories, more than 90 new icons. And the bit adds a variety of styles to each icon. To this end, we have rewritten the Icon component, replaced the `fontface` icon with `SVG`, adding a number of features that allow us to quickly use new icons and styles.
  ![](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/CVDHuodLwcDeyQBDoUIZ.png)
  - 💄 Replace the `css` font icon with the `SVG` icon, [see more discussion about it](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/10353).
  - 💄 You can now render a two-color icon.
  - 💄 We provide three theme of icons: outlined, filled, twoTone, default theme is outlined.
  - 🌟 Two new categories, **Edit Icons** and **Data Icons**, have been added.
  - 🌟 Add the `theme` attribute to set the theme style of the icon. [#11971](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/11971)
  - 🌟 Added `component` attribute, you can externally pass a component to customize the control rendering result. [#11322](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/11322)

  - 🌟 Added static methods `Icon.getTowToneColor()` and `Icon.setTwoToneColor(...)` to globally get and set the theme color of all two-color icons. [#11971](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/11971)
  - 🌟 The new static method `Icon.createFromIconfontCN({...})` is added to make it easier to use icons hosted on [`iconfont.cn`](http://iconfont.cn/). For more usage, please refer to [Ant Design Pro - Introduction to Business Icons](https://pro.ant.design/docs/biz-icon). [#11322](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/11322)
- 🔥 Added a new component [Skeleton](https://ant.design/components/skeleton/).
- 🔥 Menu will automatically close up to fit width in `horizontal` mode.

## 3.0.0

`2017-12-04`

Learn more in the [Ant Design 3.0 announcement post](https://medium.com/ant-design/announcing-ant-design-3-0-70e3e65eca0c).

### Major Changes

- New [color system](https://ant.design/docs/spec/colors#Color-Palettes), We changed our primary color from 『`#108EE9`』 to 『`#1890FF`』, we called the new primary color "拂晓蓝 (Daybreak Blue)" which means the color of the sky at daybreak.
- New design of components.
- Increased the base font size from 12px to 14px.
- Changed default locale to `en_US`.
- Support React 16.
- Better TypeScript support.
- New [List](https://ant.design/components/list/) component.
- New [Divider](https://ant.design/components/divider/) component.
- 30 New [icons](https://ant.design/components/icon/).

### Breaking Changes

> We suggest you upgrade to latest 3.x version directly.

> Some APIs may be deprecated in other 3.x versions which don't described below, please pay attention to warning in browser console and upgrade them.

We provide a [migration tool](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-migration-helper) to help you find deprecated usages in your codebase.

- Card's `noHovering` has been renamed to `hoverable`, and its default value now is `true`.
- Added new Grid breakpoints. [#7230](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/7230)
- Form `getFieldDecorator`'s `exclusive` option has been removed.
- Added `Form.createFormField`, and you must use it to wrap field data returned in `option.mapPropsToFields`:

  ```diff
  import { Form } from 'antd';

  Form.create({
    mapPropsToFields() {
      return {
  -     name: { value: 'antd' },
  +     name: Form.createFormField({ value: 'antd' }),
      };
    },
  })
  ```

- Improved global reset style, if you encounter style problem after upgrading, you can try import our v2 compatible style.

  ```javascript
  import 'antd/lib/style/v2-compatible-reset';
  ```

  Or use less

  ```less
  @import '~antd/lib/style/v2-compatible-reset.less';
  ```

- Since we changed default locale to en_US, LocalProvider is not required any more for English users.
- We don't set `size="large"` to `Input` in `Form` by default any more.
- `Input.Search` 🔍 icon don't be interactive anymore, you can use new `enterButton` prop to add a button after input.
- UMD version of `dist/antd.js` doesn't include moment any more, you need add moment by yourself if you are using the UMD version.
  ```diff
  <html>
    <head>
  +   <script src="https://unpkg.com/moment@2.19.3/moment.js"></script>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/antd@3.0.0/dist/antd.js"></script>
    </head>
  </html>
  ```
